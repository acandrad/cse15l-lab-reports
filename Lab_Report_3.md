## Streamlining ssh Configuration

1. In order to streamline ssh Configuration, you first need to make a `config` file in the `.ssh` directory like ![this](Screenshots/ConfigPic.png) which you can do through VScode like ![this](Screenshots/ConfigEdit.png)
2. You can then move this `config` file into the `.ssh` directory from VScode and once you do that you should be able remotely log in from your computer using the alias you picked like ![this](Screenshots/SSHLog.png)
3. Now that it is easier to log in to the remote server, it becomes easier to `scp` files as you don't need to type out the whole username and address and instead only need a simple command like ![this](Screenshots/SCPCopy.png) and you can see the results in the remote server ![here](Screenshots/SCPSuccess.png)
